# N-grams in Natural Language Processing

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **N-grams** for text processing and analysis.  
An N-gram is a sequence of `N` words (or characters) used in NLP to model language, identify word patterns, and analyze context.

The notebook provides:
- Preprocessing of text data (cleaning, tokenization).
- Generation of unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, and higher-order n-grams.
- Frequency analysis and visualization of n-gram usage.
- Examples of practical applications in NLP.
